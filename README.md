Deep Learning Based Electric Pylon Detection in Remote Sensing Images
In this repository, we try to use deep learning method to detect electronic pylons in remote sensing images. We provide a dataset which contains 1500 remote sensing images. Dateset can be found in https://pan.baidu.com/s/1zCVAmcldxAupEi1d9oe27Q, password is ld2b.
We also offer ten deep learning models which contain Faster R-CNN, Cascade R-CNN, Grid R-CNN, Libra R-CNN, Retinanet, YOLOv3, YOLOv4, Retinanet FreeAnchor, FCOS and Retinanet FSAF.
For time reasons, we uploaded a zip of unpolished code, and the code is still being sorted out. Detailed code and usage details of the code are expected to be uploaded by July 10, 2020.
